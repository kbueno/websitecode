				<p>This is the basic layout of an HTML document. Notice that we've shown you how to <b>comment</b>. Commenting is useful in clarifying a piece of code that is confusing or letting a partner know what that piece of code is for. The <b>DOCTYPE</b> at the top is just used to tell the internet what type of HTML you are using (don't worry about that now, just use plain HTML). To start, we must place everything inside what is called <b>tags</b>. That is what you see inside the greater than and less than signs. You also must <b>close</b> most <b>tags</b> and you do that by using a <b>backslash</b>. The <b>head</b> portion is what shows up on the tab or at the top of the screen as shown in the right side of the picture. The <b>body</b> is what appears in the browser and is usually in a paragraph. As you can start to see, most tags reflect exactly if not close to what they do.</p>

				<p>Here we've begun to add a little bit more HTML. Really the only other thing you need to include in the <b>head</b> portion is a link to your CSS document and thats what that second line in the <b>head</b> dbonstrates. Next we've added <b>ul</b> which stands for unordered lists and appears as bullets. There is also <b>ol</b> for ordered lists which appears as a numbers set. Under <b>ul</b> or <b>ol</b> be sure to use <b>li</b> which stands for list itb! We've also added an image which does not need a closing tag. For <b>img</b>, you can specify the source (<b>src</b>) as an image URL from the Internet or just the name of the image from your computer. We'll look more at that later, but be sure to specify the width and height! Lastly, we put in a link. The <b>br</b> you see in front of that link just means break page or in other words, go to the next line. To specify a <b>link</b> there are two parts. The portion inside the quotation is the address or URL while the portion in purple is the text that will be displayed for that link. These are the basic elbents of HTML and can be mixed and matched however you like.</p>

				<p>This is what a basic CSS document looks like. Anything that has a <b>tag</b> can be modified in CSS. You can choose <b>font sizes, font families, font color, positioning, spacing, backgrounds</b>, etc. The only way to know how something works in CSS is to just play around with it. There are several ways to do one task and no one way is better than another. It's all a matter of preference to you! The same goes for the units attached to these specifications. Some use <b>px</b> for pixels, <b>pt</b> for point size, and <b>%</b> for percentages. For colors, there are multiple ways as well. Sometimes you cn use certain universal colors like black and white while other times you can use <b>rgb</b> which contain a mix of six numbers and letters. It all depends on what you want your page to look like so go explore! </p>
