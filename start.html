				<p>HTML is the Internet's coding language that displays content to the screen. This includes any and all text and the different ways we organize our text like paragraphs, lists, and tables. CSS, on the other hand, is the Internet's coding language for the presentation of that content. This includes aspects like postioning, colors, and borders. </p>

					<p>Before you can begin to code, there are a couple things to take care of. First off, you need a place to make your code. So open up the Notepad program or something similar which can usually be found in your computers accessories. Although there are other types of programs that you are more than welcome to use, we recommend using Notepad because it is the most simple. Next make sure to change the setting of your Notepad to plaintext instead of richtext. Now you are ready to begin coding. To start, we recommend making two files: default.html and style.css. The default.html is like your "homepage", but you can use it for experimenting around. The style.css is the where your CSS code will mostly be located.</p>
					<p>A couple more notes. This is the fast paced verison of someof the sites that we learned from so our hope is that you will catch on to the patterns that occur within the code. On the tutorials page there will be code with a corresponding picture and a small description so you can locate exactly what your looking for. We don't cover everything in HTML but we do show you what we used to make this site and tricks that other sites fail to mention! Enjoy! </p>
